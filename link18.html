日本解禁集体自卫权或许对中国并非坏事<br><br>
 

邓聿文 <br><br>

2014年07月09日<br><br>


   
 


安倍晋三内阁刻意选在日本自卫队成立60周年的7月1日通过解禁集体自卫权，其所放出的信号十分清楚。曾遭受日本侵略的中国和韩国对此表示了不安，而曾缔造日本《和平宪法》，给日本军国主义套上紧箍咒的美国，则对此表示支持和欢迎。
<br><br>
不过，若我们不带情绪而是冷静地审视和分析日本对集体自卫权的解禁，或许事情并非想象的那么令人忧虑。对日益右倾化的日本来说，解禁集体自卫权是迟早之事，不仅中国无力阻止，就是美国也可能奈何不了。因为这被日本视为国家走向正常化的重要一步。
<br><br>
战后由美国主导拟定的日本《和平宪法》明定放弃战斗，不能卷入国际纷争。《和平宪法》第9条规定，日本国民衷心期望基于正义与秩序的国际和平，永远放弃以国权发动的战争、武力威胁或武力行使作为解决国际争端的手段；不保持陆海空军及其他军事力量，不承认国家交战权。《和平宪法》使日本享受了长达60多年的和平红利，在美国的军事保护下集中精力发展经济，从而迅速在战争废墟的基础上崛起，一跃成为世界第二大经济体，直到2010年这一桂冠才让位于中国。
<br><br>
当然，《和平宪法》也使日本成为一个主权残缺的不正常的国家，其外交和安保受制于美国。今天的日本，在经济上是个强国的同时，在政治上则是小国，尽管其军事力量公认很强，但国际话语权有限。日本右翼认为，这都是以美国为主导的战胜国将不公平的战后国际体制加诸日本的结果，而其最主要的表现，就是《和平宪法》。故而日本要成为正常国家，首当其冲必须改变《和平宪法》，尤其是宪法第9条。
<br><br>
二战已经过去了近70年，世界形势和国际秩序发生了翻天覆地的变化，从一个大的历史框架看，苏联帝国的崩溃和冷战的结束，中国的持续崛起以及随着美国实力的相对下降而来的单极格局的解体，都将影响历史走势。在这样的一个过程中，世界主要大国在经历一个再正常化的过程。例如，中国要恢复其在历史上的东亚地位（不是秩序），俄罗斯要求与西方平等，印度也要复兴其古老文明，日本自然也要谋求摆脱战后体制的束缚。站在日本的角度，这是合理的要求，其他国家应予以理解和尊重，日本右翼认为，这与日本在历史问题上的“不正确”认知是两个问题，不应将它们混淆。
<br><br>
客观来看，日本成为正常国家的要求有其合理的一面，中韩若以历史问题为由杯葛日本，很难站住脚，换言之，日本歪曲历史不是其不能成为正常国家的必要条件。我们可以要求日本正视其侵略亚洲国家的历史认知，但不能反对日本成为一个正常国家的合理诉求，这里面虽有联系，但是两个层面的问题。所以，面对日本解禁集体自卫权，中方这次并未表达坚定反对之意，只是敦促日本要慎重其事，不得损害中国安全利益以及区域和平稳定。
<br><br>
和平非战仍是日本主流民意
<br><br>
对中国来说，目前最担心的是，一旦日本解禁集体自卫权，允许军队出国参战，在中国与包括日本在内的周边国家存在东海、南中国海争端的情况下，是否会诱发日本的军事冒险，与中国发生武装冲突？这种可能性不能讲没有。因为解禁决议允许日本即使没有直接遭攻击，也可参与针对他国的战争。而且该决议还特别针对“离岛”问题指出，在岛屿未受侵占时，日本政府可在判断警察力量无法对应时，以及防止受害为理由，下令自卫队展开武力行动。这都有明显的针对中国之意，可见，解禁集体自卫权赋予了日本先发制人的权力。
<br><br>
不过，也不要高估此种可能性。安倍虽好战，但他应该还有起码的理性，认识到目前的形势不是二战前夕，现在的日本也不是那个大日本帝国，国内不仅有强大的和平力量，国外还受到美国等强国的牵制，而中国也不是当年那个羸弱的中国。尽管日本日益右倾，但毕竟经过了60多年的民主化改造，和平而非战争仍是日本的主流民意，和平力量仍然在日本国内非常强大，对此，要有充分的体认。所以，安倍在面对日本国内近年来针对解禁集体自卫权而发起的规模最大的抗议活动，才会说，那些认为日本将参与保卫外国战争的看法是个“误解”，并明确表示日本不会参与像1990年的波斯湾战争或是2003年的伊拉克战争。你可以认为这是安倍在辩解，但安倍政府也不得不为放宽自卫权设置了一个“武力行使三条件”，强调只是“有限地”行使集体自卫权。
<br><br>

退一步说，即使日本没有放宽集体自卫权，它在中日发生岛屿冲突时发动先发制人打击，或者武力支持同中国对抗的国家，也是可以找到办法的。所以，解禁集体自卫权并非是问题的关键，而在于日本政府今后在行使解禁后的集体自卫权时，能否受到国会和民意的约束。而从主流民意反战来看，日本政府不大可能在出兵国外的问题上一意孤行。
<br><br>
从中国的角度看，对日本突破战后国际秩序，破坏地区稳定的野心当然必须保持高度警惕，然而，既然阻止不了日本解禁集体自卫权，就得接受这个现实，好比日本阻止不了中国崛起，最终也必须接受现实一样。眼下中国要做的事情，是做好国际上的文宣工作，严厉谴责日本抛弃《和平宪法》之举，揭露日本军国主义的本质，把日本塑造成一个地区和平和国际秩序破坏者的形象，尽最大可能在舆论上孤立日本。除此之外，做好军事斗争准备，加快推进军事现代化，这是保卫国家安全的最好办法。
<br><br>
从军事斗争准备的角度看，日本此举实是帮了中国一个大忙，它为中国强军备战提供了一个最好的理由。
<br><br>
中国为保卫自己的国土安全和全球利益，适度发展军力，固然不必看别人的脸色，但外界对中国发展军力的质疑也会对中国形成一定的战略压力，一些国家会猜疑中国的战略意图，从而恶化中国的外交和发展环境。为应付这些压力，需要花费一定的时间和成本。现在日本修改《和平宪法》，解禁集体自卫权，战后国际秩序受到日本的严重挑衅，虽然美国和西方国家出于各自利益支持日本这样做，但并不表明日本此举就具有道义和正当性，而且他们也会对日本多一份戒心。这可能促使其他国家对中国的强军战略多一份理解，以后指责中国企图用武力改变现状时，需要 “小心”一点。
<br><br>
从根本上说，日本解禁集体自卫权不是为了要同中国发生战争，而是对中国形成一种战略威慑，就像安倍宣称的“做好万全的准备反而能打消日本参与战争的企图，拥有强大的实力，这才是威慑力”。中国当然不用害怕日本的这种战略威慑，但完全可以借力使力，用危机意识激发军队的战斗力，加强军事斗争准备。从这个意义说，日本解禁集体自卫权，对中国建设一支强大的国防军，未必是件坏事。

China is clearly a great power on the rise. German history offers two possible paths: Bismarck or Wilhelm II. Which will Beijing choose? <br><br>
James Holmes <br><br>

July 5, 2014

Is today's China the Kaiser's Germany reborn -- an industrial powerhouse that entertains grand geopolitical ambitions and is prepared to march a continent over the precipice to fulfill them? Will China's bid for "true maritime power" succeed where Germany's quest for sea power failed a century ago?
<br><br>
We'll never know if we heed Heather Marie Stur's advice. Professor Stur demands that we stop comparing Iraq to Vietnam. In the process she seems to imply that comparing any two unlike cases is pointless.
That goes too far. What she's really protesting, one suspects, is the all-too-common practice of proclaiming that Iraq is Vietnam -- the historical Vietnam War having devolved into "Vietnam," shorthand for American hubris and failure. Calling a foreign undertaking another Vietnam offers an easy way to play gotcha with intellectual rivals. And as Stur suggests, sloganeering of that type does indeed make for slipshod history.
<br><br>
But the purpose of historical comparison isn't to unearth cases that are just alike, is it? Cases separated in time, space, and sociopolitical context never are.
<br><br>
Now admittedly, two cases must resemble each other to some degree. The past has to echo loudly enough from one case to another to make comparing them worthwhile. But the purpose of such analytical ventures is to detect similarities, expose differences, and learn what we can from the enterprise. In so doing -- in using the past as a standard for judging the present and glimpsing the future -- practitioners and scholars school their foresight.
<br><br>
Iraq is like Vietnam in major respects. It differs in others. The process of figuring out which is which imparts strategic wisdom. Wisdom is good.
<br><br>
Which brings us back to Imperial Germany and Communist China. The likeness between the rising European and Asian powers appears striking -- in a superficial way, at least. Like freshly unified Germany, China is an industrial power on the make. Like Germany, China is emerging from a protracted period of disunity, weakness, and subjugation at outside hands. And like Germany, China is ruled by a youthful regime bearing a chip on its shoulder.
<br><br>
The sea, furthermore, beckons to the Chinese Communist Party as seductively as it once beckoned to Kaiser Wilhelm II and his lieutenants. Saltwater constitutes a medium whereby continental nations make themselves prosperous, radiate geopolitical power outward, and burnish their standings among nations. Beijing, like fin de siècle Berlin, views overseas commerce, merchantmen and ships of war, and access to foreign seaports as the lineaments of sea power. Both autocracies set out to amass these trappings of commercial and naval might -- and did so with aplomb.
<br><br>
The similarities between the two aspirants, then, are many and striking. And yet the differences are many and equally compelling. Consider. A few years back China Central Television compiled a series of books and TV specials titled The Rise of the Great Powers. This constituted an effort to learn from past rising powers' successes and failures, fashioning guidance useful to China's leadership.
<br><br>
The historians' takeaways from the German experience were especially illuminating. When shaping policy and branding itself for foreign audiences, they intimated, Beijing should emulate Otto von Bismarck's Germany rather than the Kaiser's.
<br><br>
Why? True, Bismarck, the Second Reich's Iron Chancellor, orchestrated German unification through a series of limited wars, against Denmark, Austria, and France. But afterward, as peacetime chancellor, he went to extraordinary lengths to convince Germany's neighbors that the united Reich was a "sated" power harboring no further designs on their territory. And he evinced little interest in colonies or a big navy. Such a navy might signal that Germany meant to square off against Great Britain's Royal Navy, the premier seagoing force of the age, for mastery of the waves. It might bring about needless strategic competition or strife.
<br><br>
Bismarck's humble foreign policy kept Germany safe during his tenure in Berlin. Such adoit peacetime statecraft is worthy of emulating -- hence the accolades the CCTV filmmakers showered on him. Yet Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck from office in 1890. He lacked the Iron Chancellor's self-restraint, while no subsequent chancellor could manage the erratic monarch. Instead the Kaiser and his state secretary of the navy, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, set out to build a fleet of short-range, heavily armored, heavily gunned battleships and battlecruisers. Britain could interpret this force only as a direct threat to its naval supremacy -- and thence to the maritime empire that depended on ruling the waves.
<br><br>
In effect, then, the German leadership pointed a gun at London's head, demanding that it make way for German sea power -- or else. The Anglo-German naval building spree that ensued helped give rise to the animosities that precipitated world war in 1914. The Chinese historians saw this as a grave strategic error. They advised Chinese officials not to make Wilhelm II the face of Chinese strategy as they strive to manage relations with America, the supreme sea power of our day. Bismarck is a more trustworthy guide.
<br><br>
Sage counsel. Yet these days, alas, Beijing's naval ambitions -- and its diplomatic conduct -- evoke the Kaiser more than Bismarck.<br><br>
Indeed, the comparison is disquieting. China promises to be a far more formidable seafaring state than Imperial Germany ever was, with leadership that's just as mercurial. It boasts far more maritime potential than Germany, measured in economic resources, manpower, shipyards, you name it. For all Beijing's fretting over Asia's offshore island chains, moreover, China's maritime geography is far more permissive than Germany's. Germany's major competitor lay athwart its access to the Atlantic high seas, leaving only narrow corridors to the north and south. Royal Navy men-of-war could barricade those waterways, confining the German High Seas Fleet to the North Sea without venturing far from their homeports in the British Isles.<br><br>

One German pundit lamented that commanding the North Sea was like commanding a "dead sea" such as the Caspian. Berlin could do it -- but why bother?<br><br>
Geography is a friend to China, relatively speaking. Chinese vessels enjoy numerous entryways to the Pacific or Indian Ocean high seas. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) can bring land-based air and missile forces, along with swarms of submarines and missile patrol craft, to bear in waters and skies Beijing cares about. And while its chief competitor, the U.S. Navy, has strongholds in the Western Pacific, the bulk of the American fleet is based thousands of miles away, in places like Honolulu and San Diego. It's hard, and expensive, and perilous to stage operations in Asian waters from naval stations that remote. Advantage: China.<br><br>

And lastly, China followed a very different intellectual pathway to sea power. Germans were followers of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, America's prophet of sea fights between symmetrical fleets of capital ships. Indeed, the Kaiser reported trying to memorize Mahan's masterwork, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783.<br><br>

Thus inspired, Berlin pitted strength against strength in its naval arms race with the Royal Navy, the gold standard for capital-ship strength. It's tough for a newcomer to match an established power in a ship-for-ship competition. Yet Germany tried it. Only in the years immediately preceding the Great War -- when it became obvious Germany could never win the battleship-building race -- did Berlin shift resources into asymmetric craft such as subs and torpedo boats. Small craft wrought outsized damage during the Great War.<br><br>

Things are different in Asia today. While China accepts Mahan's general logic of sea power -- indeed, this long-dead American navalist commands virtual rock-star status there -- it reversed the German pattern of naval development. PLA officers and weaponeers focused first on asymmetric weaponry, then turned their energies to symmetrical, blue-water platforms such as aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious transports.<br><br>

Why the disparity? Because while Chinese sea-power proponents render fealty to Mahan on the big questions -- the need for commerce, bases, and ships -- they look to their own traditions for practical insight into how to make and execute maritime strategy. Mao Zedong supplies that insight through his doctrine of "active defense." Mao's military writings are all about how a weaker antagonist can turn the tables on a stronger one. Offshore, it does so by deploying asymmetric capabilities -- access-denial forces in current parlance -- to make operating off China's shores so costly and hazardous that an opponent may decide the endeavor isn't worth it. If so, China wins by default.<br><br>

By fielding a panoply of access-denial hardware and tactics, the PLA granted itself time, and leisure, to experiment with blue-water platforms. It also spared itself a ship-for-ship arms race reminiscent of the Anglo-German competition. Cunning. If you can assert a measure of control over your offshore environs with shore-based aircraft and anti-ship missiles, while dotting the near seas with large numbers of subs and small craft, why not do it? Why not use Maoist methods and widgets to achieve Mahanian goals?<br><br>

So both the similarities and the differences between Communist China and Imperial Germany yield insight -- making this a comparison worth undertaking. The upshot? That Germany, the strongest European power of the day, was the easier nut of the two for a leading sea power to crack. That's a sobering prospect as we peer ahead.<br><br>

Theresa May vows child abuse inquiry will take on the establishment<br><br>

Inquiry may examine security service files and claims the Tory whips' office in the 1970s may have suppressed allegations
<br><br>
  

Patrick Wintour, political editor <br><br>

  
The Guardian, Tuesday 8 July 2014<br><br>

A soul-searching national inquiry into how authorities may have ignored systematic child abuse in some of Britain's most eminent institutions was launched by the home secretary.<br><br>

Theresa May told the Commons she was establishing a powerful public inquiry into how complaints of sexual abuse were treated, and sometimes ignored, in public bodies over several decades.
<br><br>
Ministers had been holding out against such a sweeping inquiry, but, facing charges of an establishment cover-up, succumbed and promised there would be no no-go areas for the investigation.
<br><br>
The inquiry will be able to examine the files of the security services and allegations that the Tory whips' office in the 1970s may have suppressed allegations of child abuse by members of the parliamentary party. It is also expected to take some evidence from victims.<br><br>

Labour MPs pointed to a 1985 BBC documentary in which a former government whip between 1970 and 1973 said that the Tory whips' office, when faced by an MP involved in "a scandal with small boys", would get him out of trouble, partly so the MP then felt obliged in the future to carry out the bidding of the whips.
<br><br>
May said she would look at plans, backed in principle by the Labour MP Tom Watson, to require public servants to report allegations of child abuse to officials in a form of mandatory whistleblowing. A duty to report would place some form of culpability on a public official if they knowingly withheld information concerning suspected child abuse.
<br><br>
Downing Street's haste to bow to the cross-party Westminster mood for a public reckoning was such that May, in her statement to MPs, was unable to name the chair of the expert panel that would lead the inquiry or its precise terms of reference. Separately, May said she had appointed Peter Wanless, chief executive of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), to examine how the Home Office last year reviewed allegations of child abuse by Westminster politicians between 1979 and 1999. Wanless will report within eight to 10 weeks.
<br><br>
However, while the broader public inquiry will produce an interim report before next year's election, the full report will not be completed until afterwards, May said.<br><br>

A Home Office review last year found 114 potentially relevant files on child abuse were missing, destroyed or lost, but despite that May said last year's review found all credible evidence of child abuse had been passed to the prosecuting authorities.
<br><br>
May told MPs: "Our priority must be the prosecution of the people behind these disgusting crimes. That wherever possible C and consistent with the need to prosecute C we will adopt a presumption of maximum transparency. And that where there has been a failure to protect children from abuse, we will expose it and we will learn from it."
<br><br>
The flurry of activity follows many months of scandals involving celebrities and other figures in authority, but turned to Westminster at the weekend with claims that the former Conservative home secretary Lord Brittan had not properly handled potentially explosive allegations of child abuse by Westminster politicians brought to him in the 1980s by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens.<br><br>

Brittan came under further pressure after it emerged that he had been questioned by police in 1967 over reports that a woman had accused him of raping her. In a statementon Monday, Brittan said that allegation was "wholly without foundation" C and said he had correctly dealt with the material brought to him by Dickens.
<br><br>
The former Home Office minister David Mellor also sprang to Brittan's defence, writing in the Guardian: "Quite how this innocuous tale became the scandalous allegations and innuendos we have been hearing in recent days, beggars belief. There is no evidence whatsoever that Dickens was remotely dismayed by the way his dossier was treated, so why are so many other people anxious to be more Catholic than the Pope?"
<br><br>
Meanwhile a review by the Home Office has found that public money was given to two organisations linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange in the 1970s but the group itself was not directly funded by the taxpayer. May, the home secretary, ordered the investigation after a former employee claimed around pounds 30,000 was given to PIE by the voluntary services unit of the Home Office.<br><br>

Westminster, still suffering the reputational damage of the expenses scandal, dare not risk the charge of suppressing evidence of systematic child abuse by peers or MPs.
<br><br>
May said the wider panel inquiry, welcomed by most Westminster politicians, would have full access to papers and would, if necessary, at its request be upgraded to full public-inquiry status in line with the Inquiries Act, capable of requiring witnesses to give evidence.<br><br>

There was a tension on Monday about the extent to which the inquiry will seek out new facts or instead more broadly draw out thematic lessons on how public authorities treated complaints of the child sexual abuse C partly drawing on the experience of cases of gang abuse in towns such as Rochdale and Oxford C and whether any gaps in child protection legislation still exist. General inquiries have either completed or are already underway into how bodies such as the BBC or hospitals failed to protect children.<br><br>

May told MPs that the panel inquiry was not supposed to supplant existing police investigations saying: "I would expect the panel if they found allegations they believed were more appropriate for the police to investigate under a criminal investigation, for those allegations to be passed to the police." It would also have to consider whether calling a witness would in any way jeopardise or prejudice a criminal investigation taking place.Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, welcomed the government's decision and said the allegations "all at their heart have a similar problem C child victims weren't listened to, weren't heard, weren't protected and too many institutions let children down".
<br><br>
Theresa Mary May (1956) is a British Conservative politician who is the current Home Secretary.

Can Japan Be Switzerland? Abe's Goal With 'Collective Security'<br><br>
2/22/2014 <br><br>
Stephen Harner<br><br>

Is Switzerland a “normal” country? People who know that Switzerland is more than yodeling, chocolates, and fondu, that it is also secretive Swiss bankers (with whom, one jurisdiction and much geography removed, I once proudly worked) and lethal arms dealers, that it declined to enter the European Union, and never seriously considered adopting the Euro, may wonder.
<br><br>
And then there is Swiss neutrality. Switzerland remained neutral during the 20th century’s two world wars, and during the Cold War. But neutrality was never without a strategy and capability for self-defense. A paragraph captioned “Armed Neutrality” on the official Swiss website Swissinfo.ch reads as follows (my italics):
<br><br>
Switzerland and neutrality are synonymous but that does not mean the Swiss have no military might. The Swiss Army trains for self defense and internal security. In principle, the Swiss cannot enter military alliances unless they are attacked. They must not take sides in international conflicts and cannot give right of transit to foreign forces.
<br><br>
For Switzerland, neutrality implies armed neutrality, which explains why the country has always strived to maintain its defense at a respectable level, and why military service remains compulsory for male citizens under the constitution.
<br><br>

With the ending of the Cold War, neutrality is no longer the imperative it was for small nations. The interdependence of the modern world makes a pure and orthodox neutrality increasingly difficult.
<br><br>
Prime Minister Abe Shinzo claims to want to make Japan a “normal” country.  Has he studied the Swiss model? The geopolitical and strategic positioning manifest in Swiss “armed neutrality” quintessentially fits Japan’s current, and, especially, future circumstances within Asia.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, it would seem that nothing could be more remote from Abe’s mind. For the past two weeks Abe and his ministers have been arguing that Japan’s army, navy, and air Self Defense Forces (SDF) should be empowered to attack an adversary that has attacked a Japanese “ally” even when Japan and its forces have not been attacked first. The is the doctrine of “collective self-defense.”
<br><br>
The most likely scenario of “collective self-defense” is an attack on the forces of Japan’s sole military ally the United States. But Abe government officials have spoken of broadening the scope for possible involvement. Australia has also been mentioned.<br><br>

Would adopting the doctrine of “collective self-defense” be in Japan’s interest? Is it even possible under the constraints imposed by Article 9 of Japan’s “Peace Constitution?”
<br><br>
Taking the second question first, the answer should be no.  Two days ago, Sakata Masahiro, the authoritative former chief of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, the bureau that verifies the constitutionality of legislation and advises the government on how to interpret the constitution, publicly declared that reconciling “collective self defense” with Article 9 constraints is “impossible.”
<br><br>
Sakata’s pronouncement is a frontal challenge to Prime Minister Abe who appears determined to push through an enabling “reinterpretation” of the constitution at the Cabinet level. Such an eventuality would, according to Sakata, undermine and violate the essence of constitutional government. Similar opinions have been raised in opposition by leading newspapers.
<br><br>
Sakata is correct, and his pronouncement has resonated both within and without the halls of Japanese political power. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)-dominated government’s junior coalition partner, the New Komeito, remains unconvinced of the wisdom or constitutionality of “collective defense.”
<br><br>
Abe’s ministers continue to say that New Komeito can be brought around. I doubt this. I think Komeito will leave the government rather than yield on “collective self-defense.” A coalition breakup would be the first major domestic crisis for Abe’s government.
<br><br>
Why is Abe so determined on “collective defense?” Is it simply a desire to please the United States? Is such a policy necessary, in his mind, for Japan to become a “normal country.”
<br><br>
Some two years ago in this space I quoted Japan’s last really great prime minister, the venerable Nakasone Yasuhiro, who had written in the Bungeishunju that the aim of Japanese diplomacy should be to influence and direct United States policies in ways that further Japan’s objectives. The image comes to mind of a small Japanese judo wrestler who nimbly trips and turns the bulky weight of a giant American into his own victory.
<br><br>
The Pentagon has for years been pushing for an expanded Japanese defense role, including “collective self-defense.” The core of the Obama administration’s (read: Pentagon’s) “pivot” to Asia strategy is “strengthening alliances”Cmeaning, above all, U.S. bases and forces in Japan and “interoperability with Japan’s SDFCagainst a largely self-fulfilling prophesy of a “China threat.”<br><br>
Abe is deftly using U.S. defense strategy and political pressureCand the Senkaky/Diaoyu dispute with ChinaCto justify a build up of Japan’s defensive (and offensive) capabilities, notwithstanding constitutional constraints.  He would like to honestly amend the constitution and mayCafter achieving a fait accompli in reinterpreting into meaninglessness Article 9Csucceed in doing so.
<br><br>
Let me be clear: I do not oppose Japan’s strengthening its defenses. I support Abe’s amending the constitution along lines proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party. I would support in principle Japan scrapping the current U.S.-written constitution and adopting one they have written themselves, that preserves their deep commitment to avoiding war.  I, like Abe, believe that Japan should be a “normal” country.
<br><br>
Today Japan is not a normal country. It will never be one while U.S. forces and bases continue to occupy its territory, and Japanese interests are subordinated to a clearly unequal and unnecessary (indeed, counter-productive) U.S.-Japan “alliance.”
<br><br>
Ironically, I believe PM Abe also believes this. His and his country’s great problem is getting from “here” (the status quo of military protectorate) to “there”: the normality of an independent and self-reliant country.
<br><br>
There is a model, it is Switzerland. Getting there will require two or three decades. Abe is taking some steps he views as necessary now. “Collective defense” will serve as  cover for building out capabilities necessary for Swiss-like “armed neutrality,” preparing for the end of the U.S.-Japan alliance.

精英失败危及世界未来<br><br>

欧洲人将在2014年纪念一战爆发100周年。一战开启了持续三十年之久的残暴和愚蠢，摧毁了20世纪初欧洲文明取得的大部分成就。最后，正如邱吉尔(Churchill)在1940年6月所预言的那样，“新世界以其全部力量和能力”，不得不挺身而出，“拯救并解放旧世界”。
<br><br>
欧洲的政治、经济和学术精英的失败，带来了这场1914年至1945年间降临到欧洲民众头上的大灾难。他们的无知和偏见使灾难得以发生：错误的思想和邪恶的价值观大行其道。其中包括早已过时的观点，即帝国是伟大和有利可图的，战争是光荣和可控的。当时的局面就好像大国领导人都被一种集体自杀的意志所控制。<br><br>
复杂的社会依赖精英去运行，这种运行即使不正确，至少也不能错得太离谱。当精英们失败时，政治秩序就可能崩溃，一战后的战败国就是如此。俄罗斯帝国、德意志帝国和奥地利帝国被摧毁，软弱无力的继承者很快就被独裁者所取代。一战还摧毁了19世纪经济的两大基础：自由贸易和金本位制。恢复这些基础的努力导致了更多的精英失败（这一次除了欧洲精英外，还包括美国的精英）。“大萧条”(Great Depression)在很大程度上为二战创造了政治条件。之后则是冷战――民主国家与脱胎于一战的专制国家之间的冲突。
<br><br>
精英失败造成的可怕后果并不令人意外。精英与民众之间有一个不成文的约定：前者拥有权力和财产等特权；后者则获得安全――在现代社会，还有一定程度的富足。如果精英们失败了，他们就有可能被取代。取代失败的经济、政治和学术精英的过程永远充满风险。但在民主体制下，至少更换政治精英的程序是迅速和干净的。在专制体制下，这种过程往往缓慢，而且几乎总是伴随着流血冲突。
<br><br>
这并非只是历史。当今社会仍是如此。如果要以当今世界为背景，寻找一战的直接教训，我们在当今欧洲找不到，但在中东、印巴边境以及崛起的中国与邻国的紧张关系中可以看到。这些地方都存在发生致命误判的可能性，尽管幸运的是，军国主义和帝国主义的意识形态远不如100年前那么有市场。今天的世界大国都认同这样一种观念，即和平比战争的虚幻收益更有利于繁荣。然而这并不意味着西方不会再遭遇精英失败。相反，西方正在经历精英失败，只是这些失败属于对和平管理不当，而不是引发战争的失败。
<br><br>
这里有三个显而易见的失败。<br><br>

首先，经济、金融、学术和政治精英大多误解了轻率的金融自由化带来的后果。他们错误地以为金融市场具有自稳定功能，因而允许甚至鼓励大举押注债务扩张（对金融业来说，这种押注是有利可图的）。负责政策制定的精英们未能把握这其中的激励机制，最重要的是未能把握系统性崩溃的风险。系统性崩溃的灾难性后果体现在几个方面：经济崩溃、失业率飙升以及公共债务出现爆炸性增长。负责政策制定的精英们因未能阻止灾难发生而遭受质疑，金融精英们因需要接受纾困而遭受质疑；政治精英们因愿意拨款纾困而遭受质疑；学术精英（经济学家）因未能预测危机来临、也未能在危机爆发后形成应对共识而遭受质疑。纾困是必要的，但人们正确地认为，当权者牺牲了纳税人的利益来纾困有错的一方。<br><br>

FT社评：我们应该反思一战教训<br><br>

1914年1月的时候，欧洲很少有人能想到，7个月后，他们的政治和军事领袖将把全世界拖入一场灾难性的战争当中。在欧洲大多数国家的首都，公众的注意力正被其他事务所吸引。英国正忙着应付爱尔兰自治运动和国内的其他麻烦。所有巴黎人的注意力即将被“卡约(Caillaux)事件”所吸引，在这一事件中，法国政治家约瑟夫 卡约的妻子开枪打死了《费加罗报》(Le Figaro)主编，以谋杀罪接受了审判，但被判无罪。

<br><br>
1914年初担任俄罗斯帝国大臣会议主席的弗拉基米尔 科科夫佐夫(Vladimir Kokovtsov)在回忆录中说，当时圣彼得堡政坛的焦点是格里高利 拉斯普京(Grigory Rasputin)的人品问题，他是沙俄皇室的“圣人”，擅长催眠术。与此同时，一个身无分文的24岁奥地利青年画家正在慕尼黑逗留，以逃避祖国的征兵。他的名字叫阿道夫 希特勒(Adolf Hitler)。<br><br>
那年的6月28日，奥匈帝国王储弗朗茨 斐迪南大公(Franz Ferdinand)在萨拉热窝遇刺。1个多月后，战争爆发，并发展为多条战线。到1918年11月一战结束时，士兵和平民伤亡人数达到了数千万人。<br><br>
尽管在进入2014年的今天，我们没有理由担心世界即将面临那样一场划时代的重大灾难，但今天与彼时仍有一些令人不安的相似之处。今年，各国政府和民众理当举办各种庄严的仪式，纪念一战爆发100周年，悼念逝者。与此同时，我们也应清醒地反思那场持续了4年的灾难带来了哪些教训。<br><br>
第一个教训是，我们要区分引发冲突的偶然性因素，以及国际关系或国内事务中更加根深蒂固的紧张因素――后者是导致战争的根本原因――而不能混为一谈。在萨拉热窝刺杀事件前很久，就已有许多因素为一战的爆发埋下了种子。众所周知，无论是在20世纪早期还是在今天，恐怖主义事件都同样难以预防。但全球军事、政治和经济领域的紧张局势是政治家能够并且应该解决的。按照公认的国际规则行事，确保不同国家和民族之间的竞争保持有序，这是政治家的职责。<br><br>
另一个教训是，相互对立的民族主义的摩擦，加上民族自尊心、远大抱负、愚昧以及受到悉心呵护的历史宿怨，这些因素在当今引发战争的能力不输于1914年。如果随着新兴大国的崛起和传统大国的相对衰落，国际体系重写秩序，这种风险就尤其突出。100年前是德国在谋求取代英国“日不落帝国”的地位，如今这种争夺越来越明显地是在中美两国之间展开。中国与其依赖美国支持的东亚邻国近期在东中国海的争端，让人联想到1914年前夕德国与英、法、俄三国之间的紧张关系。<br><br>
边缘政策的运用在国际关系中不可避免，但尊重他方的动机和正当利益至关重要。就这一点而言，稳妥地推动伊朗核问题争端达成和解，这是一条有望成功的道路。<br><br>
第三个教训是，怀着以下想法贸然参战是愚蠢的，即：这场战争不会持续很长时间、不会耗费太多资源、不会产生不可控的后果。1914年，欧洲的一些政治家和将领就怀有这样的幻想，他们的眼光还局限于半个世纪前导致德国和意大利统一的那些有限战争。美国和英国政府2003年入侵伊拉克时也是这样想的。后来的事实证明，他们对这两场战争的估计错得多么离谱。<br><br>
最后一个教训是，如果战争真的爆发了，那么至关重要的一点是，要在战争结束时构建稳固的和平。1919-23年的巴黎和谈并未完成这一使命。到1939年，当初那个逃避征兵的奥地利青年在柏林登上了权力的巅峰，全世界即将付出比1914年更为惨重的代价。
<br><br>
反思历史能否帮助我们更好地处理当下面临的问题？如果能的话，今年的一战爆发百年纪念活动，可能为全世界带来一项巨大的福祉――促使当代政治家更多地反思萨拉热窝事件，少花些时间担心“慕尼黑危机”。<br><br>


当然，“萨拉热窝事件”和“慕尼黑危机”分别是指一战和二战爆发前的两场外交危机。然而，这两起事件一直被用来作为两种截然不同的外交事务处理方法的依据。如果领袖们警告人们要严防“慕尼黑危机重演”，那么他们几乎绝对是在主张对挑衅行为采取强硬手段――通常是通过诉诸军事手段。但如果领袖们提到“萨拉热窝”，那他们就是在提醒人们要严防战争爆发。
<br><br>

史学家通常认为，在1938年慕尼黑危机中，英国和法国对希特勒(Hitler)的姑息是个严重的错误，这种绥靖行为导致了大战的爆发。相形之下，1914年夏天，奥地利大公在萨拉热窝遇刺后引发的一连串事件，让大多数历史学家感到震惊――他们惊异于欧洲居然那么毫无顾忌地就滑向了战争。在讲述一战爆发的引人入胜的新书《战争终结和平》(The War that Ended Peace)中，玛格丽特 麦克米伦(Margaret MacMillan)哀叹道：“1914年世界政坛的所有关键人物中，没有一个称得上是伟大和富有远见的领袖，没有一个有勇气挺身而出，抵挡住把世界推向战争深渊的压力。”<br><br>


或许是因为二战距离今天更近，自1945年以来主导西方思维的是“慕尼黑”。去年夏天，美国国务卿约翰 克里(John Kerry)就采用了“慕尼黑”思维。他说叙利亚使用化学武器一事无异于一场“当代慕尼黑危机”，并呼吁西方对阿萨德(Assad)政权发动导弹打击，以必要地展示决心。
<br><br>
事实上，“慕尼黑”思维曾在无数事件中导致西方领袖做出错误决策，但这看上去并未影响这种思维的流行。1956年，时任英国首相安东尼 艾登（Anthony Eden，他曾明确反对最初的《慕尼黑协定》）以绥靖政策曾导致希特勒崛起为由，与埃及总统纳赛尔(Nasser)针锋相对，并派遣英军参与了1956年的苏伊士运河事件。美国总统林登 约翰逊(Lyndon Johnson)也以防止慕尼黑危机重演为由，继续积极介入越战。2003年，伊拉克战争的支持者也以同样理由，呼吁对萨达姆 侯赛因(Saddam Hussein)采取军事行动。在所有这些例子中，西方都毫不手软、坚决果断地使用了武力。但事后看来，这些冲突都是大错特错的。
<br><br>

相形之下，在1963年，古巴导弹危机几乎让美国和苏联发动核战争之际，美国总统约翰 肯尼迪(John F Kennedy)展现出了非凡的勇气，没有像顾问们强烈建议的那样采取军事行动。肯尼迪参加过二战，也经历过慕尼黑危机。但在做出决定的那一刻，盘旋在他脑海中的或许正是萨拉热窝事件。麦克米伦指出，在古巴导弹危机爆发前不久，肯尼迪在读的一本书是巴巴拉 塔奇曼(Barbara Tuchman)的《八月炮火》(The Guns of August)――讲述一战的经典之作。<br><br>


环顾当今世界，萨拉热窝事件重演的危险，看上去比慕尼黑危机重演的危险更迫在眉睫。没有哪位独裁者威胁要横行国际――巴沙尔 阿萨德(Bashar al-Assad)的野心似乎只局限于在叙利亚继续执政。但如同1914年前不断崛起的德国与周边邻国发生对抗一样，如今正在崛起的中国也与多个邻国――特别是日本――发生了争端。<br><br>

 What Japan's military shift means<br><br>
 
 By Dr John Swenson-Wright
 <br><br>
Chatham House 2 July 2014  <br><br>


The administration of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced a major new interpretation of the security provisions of the country's 1947 constitution, permitting its Self Defence Forces (SDF) to participate for the first time in collective self-defence related activities. 
<br><br>
In future, the SDF will, in principle, be able to assist the forces of a foreign country in situations where either the survival and security of Japan or that of its citizens is at risk. 
<br><br>
The new interpretation is highly controversial since it represents a sharp departure from the post-war political consensus, codified in Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, that explicitly limits Japan's use of military force exclusively to the defence of its sovereign territory and its people. 
<br><br>
Such has been the strength of post-war Japanese pacifist sentiment, and notwithstanding the long-term alliance with the United States, that Japan's defence forces have been unable to extend their military collaboration with their US allies beyond this narrowly circumscribed role. 
<br><br>
Under the new provisions, there are now a range of scenarios in which this type of joint defence activity might be expanded. <br><br>

Examples include providing defensive support to US forces under attack in the vicinity of Japan, co-operating militarily with US forces to safeguard Japanese citizens at risk overseas, participating in minesweeping activities during a time of war, or deploying Japanese forces to protect access to energy supplies or critically important sea-lanes of communication vital to Japan's survival. 
<br><br>
Indeed, in theory, the new interpretation will allow Japan to co-operate with any foreign country with which it has "close ties", thereby substantially expanding the scope for military co-operation with different countries and beyond the narrow remit of the defence of Japanese territory. 
<br><br>
Carte blanche?
 <br><br>
Opinion in Japan is divided on the merits of this change, with 50%, according to a recent Nikkei poll, opposing the new interpretation and 34% supporting it. The motives for opposition are mixed, in part reflecting the unresolved debate about Japan's post-war political identity, but also prompted by uncertainty regarding the long-term security objectives of the Abe administration. 
<br><br>
Progressive thinkers argue that the changes overturn the pacifist legal and interpretative conventions, established in the aftermath of World War Two, guaranteeing that Japan will never again become embroiled in foreign conflicts. Given the sensitivity and importance of these political norms, critics argue they should only be changed via constitutional amendment. <br><br>
While the Abe administration dominates both houses of the Japanese parliament, it is uncertain of its ability to revise the constitution rapidly and critics view the new interpretation as one of dubious political legitimacy.
<br><br>
There is also some fear, both within Japan and amongst its closest neighbours, most notably China and South Korea, that the new interpretation is intended to allow the government to deploy troops freely in a wide-range of conflict situations.
<br><br>
However, the Abe administration has explicitly ruled out such options and has been careful to distinguish between collective self-defence (intended to safeguard Japanese national interests and assets) and collective security - where states co-operate to protect their mutual interests in the face of foreign aggression. Mr Abe himself has made it clear that Japan's forces will not "participate in combat in wars such as the Gulf War and the Iraq War".
<br><br>
Strategic risk<br><br>
 
Mr Abe appears to have a number of motives for introducing the new interpretation. It will provide Japan with much greater latitude to strengthen its military co-operation with the United States - something that Washington is keen to encourage as part of the current revision of the Joint US-Japan Defence Guidelines, unchanged since 1997. 
<br><br>
It will also open the door potentially to more active defence co-operation with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Australia and the Philippines - both of which have welcomed these changes, as they look anxiously at China's increasingly assertive maritime posture in the South and East China seas. 
More generally, the new interpretation is likely to strengthen the perception that Japan has become a more "normal" state, in terms of its ability constructively to contribute to global and regional security. 
<br><br>
The political and diplomatic dividends from such a change in attitudes are likely to be considerable, potentially strengthening Japan's long-standing bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and adding weight to Mr Abe's recently articulated strategy of making a "proactive contribution to peace".
<br><br>
The new approach is not without risk. While Japan's mainstream political parties remain weak and divided, citizen activism in opposition to these changes may be energised, particularly at the level of local politics. Prefectural, city, town and village-based criticism of the government's approach has been vocal and may cost the government support in the spring elections of 2015. 
<br><br>
Abroad, the new measures look set to further undermine an already frayed relationship with South Korea and to heighten territorial and political tensions with China. 
<br><br>
Finally, the intentional ambiguity surrounding the details of the new interpretation provides the government with useful flexibility in deploying its forces overseas, but it also magnifies the potential for increased tactical and strategic risk at a time when regional security tensions are intensifying. 
<br><br>
For a Japanese government that has limited experience of the high-pressure challenge of national security decision-making and crisis management, this may not be an entirely positive development. 
<br><br>

1 July 2014 <br><br> 
Japan cabinet approves landmark military change<br><br>
Japan's cabinet has approved a landmark change in security policy, paving the way for its military to fight overseas. 
<br><br>
Under its constitution, Japan is barred from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence.
<br><br>
But a reinterpretation of the law will now allow "collective self-defence" - using force to defend allies under attack.
<br><br>
PM Shinzo Abe has been pushing hard for the move, arguing Japan needs to adapt to a changing security environment. 
<br><br>
"No matter what the circumstances, I will protect Japanese people's lives and peaceful existence," he told journalists after the change was approved.
<br><br>
The decision must be passed by parliament, which the ruling bloc controls. But by reinterpreting rather than revising the constitution, Mr Abe avoids the need for a public referendum. 
<br><br>
The US - with whom Japan has a decades-old security alliance - will welcome the move, but it will anger China, with whom Japan's ties are already very strained. 
<br><br>
The decision is also highly controversial in a nation where post-war pacifist identify is firmly entrenched. 
<br><br>
On Sunday a man set himself on fire in central Tokyo to protest against the change.<br><br> 
'No recovery'
 <br><br>
Mr Abe first endorsed the move in May, after a panel of his advisers released a report recommending changes to defence laws.<br><br>

Japan adopted its pacifist constitution after its surrender in World War Two. Since then, its troops have not engaged in combat, although small numbers have taken part in UN peace-keeping operations. 
What is collective self-defence?<br><br>
 
--In the past Japan could use force only in self-defence. Under the proposed change, Japan's military will be able to come to the aid of allies if they come under attack from a common enemy<br><br>
--Other conditions would apply, according to reports, including that there should be a clear threat to the Japanese state and that people's right to life and liberty could be subverted<br><br>
--Examples from officials of "collective self-defence" could include Japan shooting down a missile fired by North Korea at the US and Japan taking part in mine-sweeping operations in key sea lanes during a conflict<br><br>
--Japan's PM says the change does not mean taking part in multilateral wars, like the US-led war in Iraq<br><br>

It has long held the view that under international law, it has the right to collective self-defence, but - until today - said it could not exercise that right because of constitutional limits. 
<br><br>
Mr Abe emphasised that the change would not lead to involvement in foreign wars.
<br><br>
"There is a misunderstanding that Japan will be involved in war in an effort to defend a foreign country, but this is out of the question," he told the press conference. 
<br><br>
"It will be strictly a defensive measure to defend our people. We will not resort to the use of force in order to defend foreign forces."
<br><br>
On Monday, thousands of people joined a protest in Tokyo to oppose the change. 
<br><br>
Critics of Mr Abe fear that this move is the first step to a more permanent revision or removal of the war-renouncing Article 9 of the constitution. 
<br><br>
"I thought that if we don't stop the Abe government now then it won't be possible to recover," Etsuo Nakashima, 32, told Reuters news agency. 
<br><br>
But others believe that the constitution is a post-war relic imposed on Japan by the US that restricts it from engaging in the normal activities of a modern nation. 
<br><br>
China - with whom Japan is currently engaged in a bitter territorial dispute - says it opposes the change, accusing Japan of "remilitarising" under Mr Abe. 
<br><br>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that the new policy "raises doubts about Japan's approach to peaceful development", and accused Japan of "hyping the China threat". 
<br><br>
"We urge Japan to sincerely respect the rightful concerns of neighbouring Asian countries, diligently solve any related issues, and not affect China's rights and the stability of the region," he said.
<br><br>
South Korea has also raised objections, saying it will "not tolerate" the move which it said was made without South Korea's agreement.
<br><br>
The foreign ministry also urged Japan to ensure regional peace and stability.<br><br>

Is Shinzo Abe fanning nationalist flames?By Charles Scanlon
 <br><br>
BBC News<br><br>
23 April 2014 <br><br> 
Tensions between China and Japan are at their highest level for decades as Tokyo defies pressure from Beijing over disputed East China Sea islands. As US President Barack Obama tours the region, Charles Scanlon asks whether Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is deliberately fanning the flames of nationalism in his drive to make Japan a more assertive and self-confident power. 
<br><br>
The forlorn elderly couple handing out leaflets on a street corner on the outskirts of Tokyo had a bizarre and scarcely credible story to tell.
<br><br>
They said that their 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by North Korean secret agents while returning from badminton practice.
<br><br>
The couple told anyone who would listen that she was probably grabbed by frogmen emerging from the ocean near their home and bundled off to North Korea on a submarine.
<br><br>
To some passers-by, 14 years ago, it sounded as if the couple's grief had turned to paranoid fantasy. 
<br><br>
That was also the view of the police and much of Japan's diplomatic and political establishment.
<br><br>
But there was one ambitious politician, from a famous political family, who did take them seriously.
Shinzo Abe took up the cause of the Yokota family, and their missing daughter, Megumi, and helped drive it to the top of the political agenda.
<br><br>
He and the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, went to Pyongyang and secured a stunning confession from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Their visit led to the return of five abducted Japanese citizens - but not several others, including Megumi, who the North Koreans claimed had committed suicide.
<br><br>
The Yokotas still count on support from Mr Abe, whose government recently negotiated a first-ever meeting with their 26-year-old grand-daughter, born to Megumi and an abducted South Korean who she married during her years of captivity. 
<br><br>
Revisionist circle?
 <br><br>
Mr Abe's career received such a boost from his championing of the abduction issue that he is now serving his second term as prime minister.
<br><br>
He was able to present himself as a rare beast among Japanese leaders - someone who cared about ordinary people and was prepared to stand up to hostile neighbouring countries.
<br><br>
For many Japanese, frustrated by long years of economic stagnation and a succession of weak prime ministers, Mr Abe brings hope. He has a plan to revive the economy with aggressive stimulus measures, dubbed Abenomics. He is also admired for standing firm in the face of what is seen by many as bullying by China and the two Koreas.<br><br>
For anyone reading newspapers or watching television in China or the Korean peninsula, however, Mr Abe appears in a more sinister light. He is portrayed as a hard-line nationalist and militarist bent on rearming Japan and asserting its dominance in the region.
<br><br>
Shinzo Abe remains an ambiguous figure. He tries to cultivate the image of a well-meaning patriot, set on restoring the self-esteem of a country down on its luck. But some on the left of Japanese politics suspect a grander strategy - to undermine Japan's post-war pacifist culture and rebuild the military against a resurgent China. 
<br><br>
"Shinzo Abe has shown he can be cautious and pragmatic," says Garren Mulloy, who specialises in the Japanese military at Daito Bunka university. "He may be a nationalist, but it's really some of those around him who are the real problem - some are revisionists who are seeking to challenge the established post-war order."
<br><br>
The threat from China, with its fast-growing naval power and direct challenge to Japanese sovereignty over the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu islands, has boosted Mr Abe's popularity despite the instinctive suspicion of nationalistic rhetoric felt by many in Japan. <br><br>

Mr Abe has sent out signals that encourage rightists, who contest Japanese war guilt and favour a more authoritarian country with the emperor at its core. 
<br><br>
His visit late last year to the Yasukuni war shrine was a clear sign of his growing confidence. The shrine honours the country's war dead including convicted war criminals, and symbolises Japan's old martial spirit.
<br><br>
The government has also flirted with revisionist views of Japan's war-time aggression without firmly committing itself either way. <br><br>

The cabinet's suggestion it was reconsidering the evidence behind a 1993 apology for the sexual enslavement of hundreds of thousands of Asian women sparked such an outcry at home and abroad that Mr Abe intervened to say that the apology would stand. It is a touchstone issue for nationalists, who insist that Japan's image has been deliberately smeared by ill-intentioned foreigners. <br><br>
Some influential conservatives in Japan also deny that the Nanjing massacre of 1937 took place and want the government to withdraw its central apology for wartime aggression. 
<br><br>
Mr Abe has been more cautious. But his language is carefully calibrated to evoke nostalgia for the past with references to the "beautiful country", an image of a mythical pure Japan free of contamination from western liberalism and individualism.
<br><br>
The nationalist world view portrays Japan as an innocent victim of rapacious and hypocritical foreigners. Right-wing academics, politicians and commentators believe that Japan was forced into a defensive war in the Pacific and was obliged to accept victors' justice after its defeat.
<br><br>
Denying Japanese guilt for the war is seen as a key step in rebuilding national pride, and establishing independence from the United States. <br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">中国愚弄了世界？</a><br><br>

Naval power<br><br>
 
Some see a clear connection between such revisionism and Mr Abe's move to reinterpret a key article in the constitution that restricts the activities of Japan's military
<br><br>
But Prof Mulloy says this concern is overblown. "The idea that Japan is being militarised is fanciful. Military spending has actually fallen until recently," he said. <br><br>
"The Japanese navy is one of the best in the world after the United States. But its capabilities are front-loaded, with very little in support. The navy probably couldn't sustain effective combat operations against China for more than two weeks."<br><br>

Others agree that China is deliberately making a false link between Mr Abe's policies and the militarism of the past to try to weaken Japan internationally. <br><br>

"Whatever the views, often objectionable, of these revisionists, there is absolutely no evidence that Japan is returning to any form of expansionist military policy. Indeed... recent changes in Japanese defence policy bind Japan in to its allies and partner countries, and further reduce any possibility of an aggressive military posture," says Simon Chelton, a former British defence attache in Tokyo.<br><br> 

The present government, however, is increasing military spending and deploying forces to the south and west to meet the threat from China.<br><br>

Japan is also working to strengthen its alliance with the United States and forge military ties with other Asian countries that feel threatened by a rising China. <br><br>

Some in the Japanese foreign ministry worry that Mr Abe's ties with revisionists and war-guilt deniers could be counter-productive. He has already upset Washington by ignoring advice not to go to the Yasukuni shrine. 
<br><br>
Opinion polls also indicate that anti-Chinese sentiment has surged to new levels in Japan. 

Many Japanese are infuriated by continuing demands for apologies from Chinese communists who make no attempt to address the reality of their own history. They see the constant references to past crimes as an attempt to weaken Japan's standing in the world and shake its hold on disputed islands and offshore resources. 
<br><br>
The fear is that Mr Abe, or those around him, could exploit such sentiment for their own ends.
<br><br>
What is clear is that angry nationalism is on the rise in China and Japan, and the two feed on each other in a dangerous spiral.<br><br>

Whatever Mr Abe's true intentions, he has shown little inclination, as he attempted in his first term, to ease the dangerous tension with China and refocus on economic co-operation between the world's second and third largest economies.

Japanese government agrees to landmark change in pacifist stance 
 
<br><br>
 David McNeill   Author Biography 
<br><br>
Tuesday 01 July 2014<br><br>
Japan’s coalition government has approved a controversial reinterpretation of the nation’s pacifist constitution that will let its troops fight overseas for the first time since World War II.
The decision means Japan will be able to engage in collective self-defence and come to the aid of a military ally under attack C principally the United States.
<br><br>
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says the new strategy, which many are calling the biggest change to Japan’s defence posture in nearly 70 years, is needed to deal with growing threats in the Asia-Pacific region.
<br><br>
“The global situation surrounding Japan is becoming ever more difficult,” Mr. Abe said in a televised press conference last night.   <br><br>

“Being fully prepared is effective in discouraging any attempt to wage a war on Japan. The cabinet decision today will further lessen the chance of Japan being engaged in war. That is my conviction.” 
<br><br>
The move is backed by the United States, Japan’s main military ally, but it has been bitterly divisive in a country where pacifism is deeply embedded. Polls show that most Japanese oppose the reinterpretation.

Thousands of demonstrators have stood outside the Prime Minister’s Office in Tokyo since Monday, chanting anti-war slogans. On Sunday, a man set himself alight outside Tokyo’s busiest train station in apparent protest.
The Cabinet decision has also angered China. A stinging editorial in the Xinhua English website said Mr. Abe is “leading his country down a dangerous path” by “gutting the constitution.”
<br><br>
“No matter how Abe glosses over it, he is dallying with the specter of war through a cheap scam but at the dear cost of the souls not only of his own but also of the entire Japanese nation,” the editorial said.
<br><br>
Mr. Abe spent months negotiating the change with his government’s coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, which pledged to protect the constitution.
<br><br>
The reinterpretation is a compromise between the pacifism of New Komeito and the more hawkish line taken by Mr Abe’s Liberal Democrats (LDP).
<br><br>
A draft cabinet resolution says Japan will be able to come to the aid of an ally in limited circumstances, such as if an attack poses “an imminent threat to Japan’s survival” or the lives and rights of its people. 
<br><br>
It says the right to “minimum force” will be exercised if other means to eliminate that threat have failed. Mr. Abe says such rights are needed to allow Japan to become a “proactive” contributor to world peace.
<br><br>
Months of cabinet discussions have revealed deep divisions on the scope of interpretation for military actions allowed under the law, however, with the LDP pushing for broader powers.
<br><br>
Mr. Abe wants Japan to join minesweeping operations through sea lanes the Middle East, through which most of the oil destined for Japan passes, but New Komeito argued that clearing mines during war went far beyond self-defence.
<br><br>
Critics say the new guidelines have been left deliberately vague to allow the government more room to decide military engagements. 
<br><br>
“They’re only the opening step in future plans to send Japanese soldiers abroad,” said Hiroyuki Konishi, an opposition lawmaker who fought the changes. 
<br><br>
The constitution was written in 1946 during the American occupation of Japan. Mr. Abe is part of a conservative contingent that has long demanded it be scrapped or rewritten.
<br><br>
Protesters outside the Prime Minister’s Office last night held banners saying: “Protect the Constitution" and “My children won’t fight in war.” 
<br><br>
“Abe is ignoring public opinion and our constitution because he wants a bigger military,” said Yumiko Fujiwara. “I can’t forgive him.”<br><br>
